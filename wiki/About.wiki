#summary An overview of the Center for Domain Specific Computing and this project.

= Overview =

The [http://www.cdsc.ucla.edu Center for Domain Specific Computing] is developing a methodology and hardware platform with the goal of looking beyond parallelization and focusing on domain-specific customization to bring orders-of-magnitude power-performance efficiency improvement to important application domains. This effort involves both software and hardware innovations that include the development of:
  * A wide range of customizable computing elements, from heterogeneous fixed cores to coarse-grain customizable cores and fine-grain field-programmable circuit fabrics
  * High-performance RF-interconnects
  * Highly automated compilation tools and runtime management systems

As an application area for these developments, the Center is analyzing the domain of medical image processing, which has a high computing demand. MEdical imaging is now a routine and integral clinical tool in the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions, but many advances in this field have been constrained to the research environment due to a lack of computational power. Several medical image processing algorithms are infeasible for real-time clinical use. Power and cost-efficient high-performance computing can have a significant impact on healthcare in terms of preventive medicine (e.g., virtual colonoscopy), diagnostic procedures (e.g., automated tumor volume quantification), and therapeutic procedures (e.g., pre-surgery decision making).
